        <p>[Publication] Kim, H., <em>So, B.</em>, Han, W., and Lee, H., <em>"Natural language to SQL: Where are we today?,"</em> <proceedings>In 46th Int'l Conf. on Very Large Data Bases (VLDB) / Proc. the VLDB Endowment (PVLDB), Aug. 2020</proceedings><p/>
        <p>- This paper provides a survey and a taxonomy of existing text-to-SQL models. We perform extensive experiments to compare text-to-SQL models, show that accuracy measures used in previous studies are misleading, and compare the (semantic) accuracy of the models correctly.<p/>
        <p>- As the second author of the paper, I perform most of the experiments and participate in developing the validation tool to measure the semantic accuracy of the models.</p>
